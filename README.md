# Cosmic Whispers
A visual synthesizer inspired by the cosmos, using p5 and Tone.js

This is the project for my Bachelor's Thesis in Computer Science. It presents the Cosmic Whispers project, a creative programming platform that combines a graphic animation and music synthesis Javascript libraries (p5 and Tone.js, respectively) to create a unique musical sandbox. The main objective of this project is to inspire musicians and sound enthusiasts to explore new possibilities and create innovative musical patterns.
Cosmic Whispers allows to generate music automatically and randomly, based on intuitive and visible algorithms and movement rules on the screen, as well as variable and scale control to allow the user to create the atmospheres they want,
thanks to the dat.gui library. All this, in addition to a pleasant and artistic aesthetic design to exploit the capabilities of the libraries.
