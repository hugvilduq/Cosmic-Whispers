// TOFIX:
---------------------------------------------------

// Toolbar clicks should not count as canvas clicks

// How to move dots
// How to remove generators, rework creation with shift

// TODO
---------------------------------------------
// Make orbits out of 16, instead of 8

// Offset for the generators. They should have their beats when the user creates
//  them, not dictated by the current state of the Metronome

//Improve animations:
  //Make orbit animations more fluid
  // Improve planets animation when played. More flashy


// Add different Octave generators, for bass, chords and melody. Each one should have their own synth controls
  //  with an envelope control options (ATT,SUS,DEC,REL), graphically for ALL notes at once
  // Another section of the toolbar for drum kits (asteroids), each drum sound has its own synth control  

// Add differen types of celestial bodies:
// Asteroids for drumkit
  // Asteroid for drums, meteorite for cymbals. (see google: meteoroids)
// Comet particles for theremin
// Black hole: LPF
// white hole: HPF
// wormhole, supernova, nebula, 

// Separarate files into modules

// Make the dots move around the center of the galaxy (metronome?)

// Consult with client
// Keyboard controls?
  // Spacebar for generator, number for whiteDots, theremin always active on click

Add a dynamic background that reacts according to the amount of music created.
